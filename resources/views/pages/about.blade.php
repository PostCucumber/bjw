<p>It started at 4:30 in the morning with the Holy Spirit telling me to get up and go for a walk. I was in recovery, learning what it means to surrender. Five miles every day turned into walking across America to bring the message of hope in Jesus Christ. Big Jim’s Walk Inc. is A Journey of Hope bringing awareness to the epidemic of addiction. We are a nonprofit organization providing resources and assistance in the fight against addiction. Our vision of free, faith-based recovery centers is becoming a realty as we secure land and funds for CAMP Redemption (Christ Amplified Ministries and Programs). This is all a vision from God. It feels like an assignment I will carry out for the rest of my life. I CHOOSE to advocate addiction awareness and provide free recovery programs. Big Jim’s Walk Inc. has already gone international with thousands of followers on the internet and hundreds of community relationships across America.</p>
